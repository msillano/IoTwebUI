#### Interface: A Feast for the Eyes and Control

- Choose between the light or dark theme, according to your preferences.
- Navigate through your devices and 'homes' with a draggable and zoomable tree, perfect for keeping everything under control.
- Informative pop-ups with new icons will keep you updated on the status of each property of a device, without missing a single detail.
- A drop-down menu with configuration information and dynamic options will give you quick access to everything you need.
- And if you want to further customize, unleash your creativity with icons, colors, and informative pop-ups of your choice.

#### Data: Safe and Always at Hand

- Record the data of the properties that interest you to files, so you will always have a complete archive of your home automation.
- Calculate moving averages, or decoded or normalized values for an even more in-depth analysis.
- Choose automatic or manual saving, with data format options (CSV or JSON), sampling period, and saving frequency to suit your needs.
- Runtime management: unlimited flexibility

#### Tap-to-run Tuya: Power at Your Fingertips

- A dedicated page with a tab for each "home" allows you to have everything under control.
- Automatic loading at startup for home automation that is always ready for action.
- Launch Tuya tap-to-runs with a simple click and customize button colors for an even more intuitive experience.
- Exclude the tap-to-runs you don't need for a clean and tidy interface.

#### Alerts: Never Miss an Event Again

- You can activate a control function on any property of the devices and choose the "greater than", "equal to" or "less than" tests to monitor every aspect of your home automation.
- Same logic as Tuya conditions, for a common and reliable language.
- Choose from different consequential actions: beep, pop-up, voice message, URL launch, or Tuya tap-to-run.
- Real-time, with an average delay equal to 50% of the Tuya sampling period, for a perfect balance between speed and precision.
- Alert definition at runtime: total control in real-time

#### RULE: Thirst for More Powerful Automations? IoTwebUI 2.0 Has the Answer!

- Perform logical and arithmetic operations and use variables for unlimited flexibility.
- Compare the values of two different properties, for even freer automations.
- Perform complex actions, such as activating Tuya tap-to-runs or sending commands to other applications via REST.
- **How does it work?**
  1. Create RULES at runtime with a user-friendly interface, even if you are not an experienced programmer.
  2. Use predefined MACROs for common and repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
  3. Test your RULES in real time to be sure they work perfectly.
  4. In case of an error during the test, a pop-up will indicate the line and type of error for a quick and precise resolution.
  5. Export your RULES to include them in the configuration file and make them permanent.

#### EXPERT Mode: To Control Everything Controllable

EXPERT mode offers total control over the customization of IoTwebUI:
- Access the configuration interfaces and make changes that will be valid only for that run.
- Copy the data from the "export pad" to the configuration files to make your choices stable.
- You can disable EXPERT mode in the configuration when you have finished customizing.
