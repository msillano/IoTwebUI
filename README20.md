## Performance:

#### Interface: a pleasure for the eyes and for control

 - Choose between light and dark theme, according to your tastes.
 - Navigate through your devices and 'homes' with a draggable and zoomable tree, perfect for keeping everything under control.
 - Informative popups with new icons will keep you updated on the status of each device property, without missing a single detail.
 - A dropdown menu with configuration information and dynamic options will give you quick access to everything you need.
 - And if you want to further customize, unleash your creativity with icons, colors and informative popups of your choice.

#### Data: safe and always at hand

 - Record the data of the properties that interest you to files, so you will always have a complete archive of your home automation.
 - Calculate moving averages, decoded or normalized values for even more in-depth analysis.
 - Choose automatic or manual saving, with data format options (CSV or JSON), sampling period and saving cadence to suit your needs.
 - Runtime management: unlimited flexibility

#### Tuya tap-to-run: power at your fingertips

 - A dedicated page with a tab for each "home" allows you to have everything under control.
 - Automatic loading at startup for a home automation system that is always ready for action.
 - Launch Tuya tap-to-runs with a simple click and customize the button colors for an even more intuitive experience.
 - Exclude the tap-to-runs you don't need to have a clean and tidy interface.

#### Alerts: never miss an event again

 - you can activate a control function on any property of the devices and choose the "greater, equal" or "lesser" tests to monitor every aspect of your home automation.
 - Same logic as Tuya conditions, for a common and reliable language.
 - Choose from different consequential actions: beep, pop-up, voice message, URL launch or Tuya tap-to-run.
 - Real Time, with an average guaranteed delay equal to 50% of the Tuya sampling period, for a perfect balance between speed and accuracy.
 - Alert definition at runtime: total control in real time

#### RULES: Do you need more powerful automations? IoTwebUI 2.0 has the answer!

 - Perform arithmetic operations and use variables for unlimited flexibility.
 - Compare the values of two different properties, for even freer automations.
 - Perform complex actions, such as activating Tuya tap-to-runs or sending commands to other applications via REST.
 - How does it work?
   1. Create RULES at runtime with a user-friendly interface, even if you are not an expert programmer.
   2. Use predefined MACROS for common and repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
   3. Test your RULES in real time to make sure they work perfectly.
   4. In case of an error during the test, a popup will show you the line and type of error for a quick and precise resolution.
   5. Export your RULES to include them in the configuration file and make them permanent.

#### EXPERT mode: to control everything controllable

EXPERT mode offers total control over the customization of IoTwebUI.
  - Access the configuration interfaces and make changes that will be valid only for that run.
  - Copy the data from the "pad" of export to the configuration files to make your choices stable.
  - You can disable EXPERT mode in the configuration when you have finished customizing.
