#  Tuya APPLICATIONS 
[versione italiana](https://github.com/msillano/IoTwebUI/blob/main/APP/LEGGIMI.md)

By APP we mean an application with a user interface, that uses Tuya and IoTwebUI with REST, to achieve the most varied objectives.
They normally comprise at least two files: 
* a MACRO (**x-device**) that acts as a middleware between the devices and the user interface, implementing the 'business logic', 
* a simple user interface (usually in HTML).

We have separated them in this dir for ease of use: during installation, the files must be copied into your host's 'addon/' and 'html/' dirs.

**All available APPs are presented in [this page](https://github.com/msillano/IoTwebUI/blob/main/APP/Overviews.md).**

### Installazione e Uso
>>_note: many installation and configuration operations require the user to edit source files, due to WEBBAPP limitations. Use the usual warnings: Make a copy of the file before each change. Use a UTF8 editor (I use Notepad-plusplus). Be careful NOT to ALTER anything else (especially commas ',' and quotes '"' and "`")._

Common and general instructions. For further details see the individual APPs.

1. **minimal (without UI)**
  * Install **IoTwebUI** on the chosen server (see [IoTwebUI installation](https://github.com/msillano/IoTwebUI/blob/main/LEGGIMI22.md#installation))<br>
_note: initially delete (file `config.js`) both alarms and Logs, and set `tuyaInterval = 180` (continuous use) or `tuyaInterval = 60` (occasional use, more ready)._

  * Copy the necessary files into the **IoTwebUI** dir: _from [Github APP](https://github.com/msillano/IoTwebUI/tree/main/APP) to the `/addon` and `/html` dirs of **IoTwebUI** installed._

  * Install the required **x-device** in **IoTwebUI**.<br>
_note: instructions in the file itself `addon/xxxxx0y.js`: you need to modify the file `IoTwebUI.html`._

  * Complete the configuration of `addon/xxxxx0y.js`<br>
_In particular, check `xroom` (room: must exist), `xhome` (home: must exist) where the x-device must go, following the instructions in the file._<br>

  * If the APP requires, create the 'tap-to-run' in SmartLife to act on the Tuya devices, or whatever else is necessary to do in Tuya (e.g. _Thermostat_ requires installing a specific _virtual device_).

  * Create the necessary RULES in IoTwebUI, I recommend permanently modifying `usrrules02.2.js`. They are indicated in the `addon/xxxxx0y.js` file itself.
  
2. **Complete installation** (User Interface)<br>
_Some APPs work perfectly without UI (e.g. Thermostat) for others the UI is essential._

  * In addition to the 'minimal' installation, install [RESTserver](https://github.com/msillano/IoTwebUI/blob/main/RESTserver/READ-ME-REST22.md#installation-and-configuration)

  * Complete the configuration of `html/xxxxxx0y.html`<br> _In particular check x_term (name of the x-device, i.e. `xname`, used in the launch RULE. See above and any parameters and customizations._

3. **Use**

  * Launch **RESTserver** (file `rest02.2\run_server.bat`), then minimize the `cmd.exe` window (DO NOT close!).
  * Launch **IoTwebUI** (file `run_me.bat`)
  * press OK for _INFO: Connected to REST server!_
  * press button: _READY... press to continue_
  * Launch the **interface** by clicking on the file `html\xxxxxx0y.html` (optional). It will open in your favorite browser.

4. **Limiti** 
   * **IoTwebUI** una sola istanza.
   * **interfaccia** anche pi√π istanze se specificato nelle istruzioni.
    
5. **Troubleshooting**
* Both with **IoTwebUI** and with the **interface** right mouse click, choose 'inspect..'. Then 'console': there the error messages appear.
* For **RESTserver** the messages appear in the `cmd.exe` window
* see [issues](https://github.com/msillano/IoTwebUI/issues).
